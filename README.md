## Anonymous Mental Health Forum: Android App

We are trying to make a forum for people to
talk about their mental health while remaining
completely Anonymous so that they feel
confident enough to express their emotions
and can get advice from verified doctors and
consultants and from the people who dealt
with similar symptoms

>This forum will help people discuss their mental health while staying anonymous **to us** and the **other users**

## Features
- The Anonymity of the users is prioritized so that
they can post their problems without any hesitation

- The people who went through similar problems and
diseases can provide a guidance to the user

- Every doctor will be verified and then only they
can advice patients.

- Diabetes prediction is also developed as an add-on
feature for the app

- Remote treatment using video call features and
home delivery of medicines if user wants to.
